** Purpose

After reading *Mastering Python Design Patterns*, I wrote some codes in Python and Racket (presently) for below design patterns.

I found this is a good way to be more familiar to the new language you learn, so I will add more codes in other languages.

** Creational Patterns

*** The Factory Pattern

*** The Builder Pattern

*** The Prototype Pattern

** Structural Patterns

*** The Adapter Pattern

*** The Decorator Pattern

*** The Facade Pattern

*** The Flyweight Pattern

*** The Model-View-Controller Pattern

An architectural pattern rather than a design pattern, however, it is too important to be skipped.

*** The Proxy Pattern

*** Chain of Responsibility Pattern

** Behavioral Patterns

*** The Command Pattern

*** The Interpreter Pattern

*** The Observer Pattern

*** The State Pattern

*** The Strategy Pattern

*** The Template Pattern
